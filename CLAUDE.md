# Modal Library Project

## Project Overview
React modal library with compound component pattern, accessibility features, and portal-based rendering.

@specs.md

## Development Commands
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run build` - Build library for distribution
- `npm run lint` - Run linting (if available)
- `cd playground && npm run dev` - Start development server on port 5173

## Architecture Notes
- **CSS**: Direct class targeting (`.modalBackdrop`, `.modal`, etc.) - no namespace wrapper due to portal rendering incompatibility
- **Tests**: Use direct class assertions, not CSS modules
- **Components**: Compound pattern with `Modal.*` subcomponents
- **Portals**: Modals render to `document.body` via React portals

## Key Files
- `src/modal.scss` - Main styles (imported once in index.ts)
- `src/Modal*.tsx` - Component implementations
- `src/types.ts` - Complete TypeScript type definitions and component props
- `src/index.ts` - Library exports
- `playground/` - Development environment

## Common Issues
- If modal styles don't load: Check that CSS uses direct selectors, not namespaced
- If tests fail on classes: Ensure tests expect direct class names like `'modalBackdrop'`
- Animation issues: Use CSS-only animations, avoid programmatic timing

## Recent Fixes
- Removed CSS namespace wrapper that prevented portal-rendered modal styles from applying
- See `logs/` directory for detailed session notes

## Latest Session Progress (January 2025)

### âœ… Completed: All Priority 1 Specs Compliance Features (September 2025)
- **Animation data-state attributes**: Implemented proper `data-state` lifecycle (openingâ†’openâ†’closing) following Radix UI standards
- **Verified asChild props**: Found complete implementation across all subcomponents with full test coverage
- **ModalTrigger verification**: Confirmed proper export, full functionality, and 17 passing tests
- **Controlled modal state**: Verified sophisticated bidirectional sync between `open` prop and internal state
- **Size variants verification**: Confirmed complete CSS implementation for auto/md/full sizes with responsive behavior
- **Production build**: Fixed TypeScript errors, 97KB bundle builds successfully with proper ESM exports

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Technical Achievements
- **Industry Standard Animations**: Following Radix UI patterns with CSS-only transitions
- **Complete Type Safety**: All TypeScript errors resolved, 167 tests passing
- **Production Ready**: Clean build output with proper package.json exports
- **Specs Compliant**: All core features match specifications exactly

### âœ… Completed: Todo List Cleanup & Spec Alignment
- Reviewed and consolidated CLAUDE.md todo list for duplicates and contradictions
- Fixed Modal.Body confusion - updated specs to consistently use `<Modal.Body>` component
- Removed SCSS modules references (specs use direct classes)
- Clarified keepMounted as future feature, not current requirement
- Removed outdated tasks.md references and non-compliance sections

### âœ… Completed: useModalStack Hook Implementation
- **Files**: `/src/ModalProvider.tsx`, `/src/index.ts`, `/src/useModalStack.test.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Programmatic modal control API matching specs requirements
- **API**: `{ open, close, isOpen, getModal }` functions
- **Tests**: 5 test cases covering all functionality
- **Integration**: Exported from main library index

### âœ… Completed: Body Scroll Lock Implementation
- **Files**: `/src/useBodyScrollLock.ts`, `/src/ModalRoot.tsx`, `/src/useBodyScrollLock.test.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Cross-browser scrollbar width compensation
  - iOS-specific handling with position: fixed
  - Layout shift prevention via `--scrollbar-compensation` CSS variable
  - Automatic activation when any modal opens
- **Tests**: 8 comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios
- **Demo**: Interactive example in `/src/Example/ScrollLockDemo.tsx`

### âœ… Completed: Modal.Body Component Implementation
- **Files**: `/src/ModalBody.tsx`, `/src/types.ts`, `/src/modal.scss`, `/src/Modal.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Semantic structure with Header/Body/Footer pattern
  - Automatic overflow scrolling when content exceeds viewport height
  - Consistent spacing and mobile responsive behavior
  - asChild support for custom elements
  - Beautiful custom scrollbars (including dark mode)
- **Tests**: 7 comprehensive test cases covering all functionality
- **Demo**: Interactive examples in `/src/Example/ModalBodyDemo.tsx`

### âœ… Verified: Mobile Fullscreen & Accessibility Already Complete
- **Mobile Responsive**: CSS rules already implement fullscreen on â‰¤768px devices
- **Accessibility**: Complete aria-labelledby and aria-describedby linking already working
- **Demos**: Created verification examples for both features

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights & Decisions
- onInteractOutside was already fully implemented (found in 7 files)
- Modal.Body component approach chosen over div className for API consistency
- Body scroll lock was critical UX gap - now resolved with modern best practices
- Mobile responsive and accessibility were already complete - just needed verification
- Build verified successful - all functionality working
